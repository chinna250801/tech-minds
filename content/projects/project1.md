title: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis
description:
  I have completed a project on multimodal sentiment analysis where I implemented a Flask backend web interface. The project provides two options- importing individual modules (image, text, audio, video) to determine each emotion, or integrating modules to find the overall sentiment. Different algorithms were used within the TensorFlow framework, achieving 96% accuracy.
